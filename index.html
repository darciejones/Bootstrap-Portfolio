            <p> Hi! My name is Darcie Jones and I relocated to the NOVA area about 2 years ago to teach Tech Ed. I am originally from a small town in Pennsylvania and still not adjusted to this area. I moved here with my rescue Mini Lop rabbit, Bebe who unfortunately passed away last year. I currently have a Holland Lop named Cricket Digby and his attitude fits his name (he has free roam, a bunny condo, and pretty much the entire house). When I do get free time, I love to spend time outside running and traveling and attending shows in DC (my hometown is 4 hours to a city, 45 mins. to a mall, etc.) so that was something I never really got to do. I love alt rock and have had the opportunity to see my favorite band, the Foo Fighters, twice now! </p>
